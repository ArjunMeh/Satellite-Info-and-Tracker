# Satellite-Info-and-Tracker
An android application that tracks and provides information of desired space satellites.

**Problem Statement:**\
There is an issue of tracking the desired satellites and obtaining the information. Satellite trackers are only available on websites. Mobile Application can be used effectively for this job as they are widely used and are known for easy access.

**Proposed Solution:**\
In this project,we propose a "Satellite tracker" and "Satellite wiki" solution to keep track of desired satellites and gather required information on them. This application stores a list of satellites that can be tracked via Network API from the internet. This application will prove very useful to the students of STAC of IIT Mandi because of the tracking data displayed(altitude,longitude,latitude,etc).

**Functionality & Concepts used:**\
This application has an interactive interference to help users track the satellites and read their information.
Concepts used for functionality in the application:
1) Android Jetpack(Navigation component): It is a suite of libraries to help with app development and reduce boilerplate code.
2) Livedata: It is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
3) Viewmodel: It is a class that is responsible for preparing and managing the data for an Activity or a Fragment.
4) Room Database: It is a database layer on top of an SQLite database. Room uses the DAO to issue queries to its database.

**Application Link & Future Scope:**\

This application is meant to be a showcase and not a full scale version. There is a limited number of satellites to be tracked.

Once the application is fully tested and deemed reliable,it can track additional satellites to expand it and make it useful for the college and community.
